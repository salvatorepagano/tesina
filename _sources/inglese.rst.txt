The history of NASA
===================

In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard.

After the Soviet space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts.

The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower
counseled more deliberate measures.

The result was a consensus that the White House forged among key interest groups, including scientists committed to basic research;
the Pentagon which had to match the Soviet military achievement; corporate America looking for new business; and a strong new trend in public opinion looking up to space exploration.

The birth of NASA

When NASA opened for business on October, 1958, it accelerated the work already started on human and robotic spaceflight.

NASA's first high profile program was Project Mercury, an effort to learn if humans could survive in space.

This was followed by Project Gemini, which used spacecraft built for two astronauts to perfect the capabilities needed for the national objective of a human trip to the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

Project Apollo achieved that objective in July 1969 with the Apollo 11 mission and expanded on it with five more successful lunar landing missions through 1972.

After the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Projects of the mid-1970s, NASA's human spaceflight efforts again resumed in 1981, with the Space Shuttle program that continued for 30 years.

The Shuttle was not only a breakthrough technology, but was essential to our next major step in space, the construction of the International Space Station.

Why NASA was created

NASA was created largely in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik in 1957.

It was organized around the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which had been created by Congress in 1915.

NASA’s organization was well under way by the early years of **Pres. John F. Kennedy’s administration** when he proposed that the United States put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

To that end, the Apollo program was designed, and in 1969 the U.S. astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person on the Moon.

Later, uncrewed programs—such as Viking, Mariner, Voyager, and Galileo—explored other bodies of the solar system.
